# VELV code challenge

## To run the project

Right click this link and open it in a new browser tab: 

https://phpsandbox.io/n/indigo-owen-lars-x3w4c

This will start a PHPSandbox server with the code from this repository.

The page can be viewed in the preview window on that page but for a better user experience please view the page on a new browser window by clicking the button on the top right of the Preview panel or clicking this URL: https://x3w4c.ciroue.com/

## Tests
To ben able to run the tests the Sandbox "notebook" needs to be forked, to then allow access to a Terminal.

After forking, open a Terminal on the project by clicking the + sign below the Preview panel.
* Run ```$ vendor/bin/phpunit```
* Run ```$ vendor/bin/phpstan```

I can also provide a new repository with a Docker container and some instructions if needed.

## Note
The server only runs when it is in use and it will shutdown after being idle for a few minutes.

If this happens please re-open or refresh the PHPSandbox page and this should restart the server.
