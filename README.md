# VELV code challenge

## To run the project

Open PHPSandbox: https://phpsandbox.io/n/indigo-owen-lars-x3w4c

This will start a server.


The project can be viewed in the preview window or on this URL for a larger browser window: https://x3w4c.ciroue.com/


## Note
This is a Sandbox environment and it only runs when it is in use so please note that the server will stop if idle for a few minutes.

In that case, refreshing the phpsandbox page should restart the server.
